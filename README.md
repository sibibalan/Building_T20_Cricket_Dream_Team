Welcome to our T20 Cricket Dream Team project, where we have curated the perfect 11-player team for the 2022 T20 Cricket World Cup. In this README, we'll walk you through the exciting journey of how we assembled this stellar team.

## Project Overview

### Data Collection

The foundation of our project started with web scraping. We collected raw data from the ESPN website using the powerful Beautiful Soup library. This data served as the starting point for our cricket dream team selection process.

### Data Preprocessing and Transformation

The raw data, although valuable, needed some refinement to be useful. We turned to the magic of data manipulation with Pandas and Power Query (Power BI) to preprocess and transform the data. This step was crucial in ensuring that we had a clean and structured dataset to work with.

### Data Visualization Dashboard

The transformed data came to life in the form of an interactive and insightful Data Visualization Dashboard, created using Power BI. This dashboard not only helped us analyze player statistics but also made the decision-making process more engaging.

### Player Selection Process

The final and most exciting step was selecting the 11 players that make up our T20 Cricket Dream Team. The selection process was guided by the analysis we conducted in Power BI and the flexibility offered by parameter scoping. We considered a variety of factors, including batting and bowling performance, fielding skills, and the ability to thrive under pressure.
